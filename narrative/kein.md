# Kein - Session 1.
 
I met 'Mad' Martigan and Hudson. It was after I accidentally stepped on an important package for a client and compensating for it. I was supposed to meet Hoya, but he cancelled the meeting at the very last moment. I was a bit sad, but Mr. Martigan and Mr. Hudson seemed to be good fellows (though I am still afraid of Mr. Hudson a bit. He said it was just an accident, but the pain!)--after all, we had caught the assassins trying to kill Phon Quartermail. Even though I could only get one gold (damn it my clumsy hands!), it was still a step forward to save up for my future exploration to home, not to mention potential travel mates.
 
# Kein - Session 2.
 
Arvid often gets into troubles many times because of her 'career.' She should know about the gang, but the problem is that I don't know where she is. Hopefully, Father Fabitor knows her whereabouts. With Martigan and Hudson, we went to talk to him.
 
Phon was very discrete. Hudson seemed to have perceived something, but there was nothing concrete. Martigan bluffed, trying to get more information, but Phon was adamant on her secrecy. I was like, 'fine,' and tried to got to a guard house to report, but Father Fabitor mentioned gold: 80 gold each. I took the job.
 
To get more information, I asked the father about Arvid. Phon strangely babbled about Marta, probably Arvid in disguise. Yet, she was not there. The desk ladies told us that she would come in early tomorrow morning. Martigan seemed to worry about Marta, but, if she was indeed my friend, she could hold on her own.
 
Anyway, she was not there, so we decided to go to the warehouse. On the way, we saw many people on 'Shivers.' Poor souls.
 
The warehouse seemed to be used recently--no cobwebs. I believe it was there to 'cut the loose ends.'
 
On the next day early in the morning, we went to Phon's shop to talk to 'Marta.' She had a job for me, and I needed some information. Martigan and Hudson was adamant, so, in the end, she gave us a hint on Phon's financial situation.
Apparently, she was a mistress of some rich dude. Though we tried to drill for more information, all our efforts failed.
