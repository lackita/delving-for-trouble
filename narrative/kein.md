# Backstory

## Character Arc

On one snowy day when I was but a boy, I found a mysterious device. Curious, I pressed a button, which activated Hover ability. Unable to master the usage of the device, I was drifted into the sky until the ability's duration ended.
 
When I landed, I found myself in middle of a city that I had never heard. Moreover, people in the city spoke in the language that I never heard. It took me some time to learn the language and earn a living. My goal is fairly simple: To go back home.

## Background

I lived in a mountain range. As a son of rangers, I learnt various skills from the early age, and they came handy when I started mercenary/postal works.
 
I usually travel between cities to deliver packages and escort people, though I break the stuff about a quarter of times. (Therefore, I always prefer escort mission.) As such, I did not gather large sums of money for me to travel to wilderness and try to find my home. Still, I am optimistic about it. After all, my customers like me...

## Personal Goals

First, earning enough money to explore.
Second, use the money to go back home.

## Appearance

I have blue eyes and black-ish hair that changes to dark blue under sunlight. I have a metal belt that gives gives me the ability to control gravity, though I am afraid to use the device.

## Mannerisms

I always fiddle with the belt's buttons when I'm bored. Though I am clumsy, I have fiddled with it so much that I no longer activate its ability by accident. Also, I tend to look at people's nose when I talk so that I can pretend to look people in the eyes.

## Additional Connections

There is a friend, named Hoya, of noble descendant in the Temple District who studies to become a priest. He was the one who took pity on me (or was it? I think he found me floating around helplessly very amusing and decided to help me.) and taught me everything, including the language of the city. When he finishes his dissertation and becomes a proper priest, we will be having an adventure together. He always tries to trick me, and I fall for it most of the times.
 
For a few years, I would follow him around until I decided to go on an adventure to find my home. For a farewell gift, he did give me a bag of money, but it was stolen on day one by a member of a thief's guild. I know the person, but I could not get enough evidence to get her arrested.
 
Anyhow, I sometimes drop in by Ptlos to say, "Hi," to the friend.

## Allies, Relatives, Contacts, and Organization Affiliations

Hoya, a paladin candidate, helps me sometimes, like one time when he fetched me an escort mission.
 
Arvid, who stole my money, sometimes asks for a help to find a murderer when the thief guild is framed. Though she does not pay handsomely, she does pass on informations I need (sometimes after paying a huge amount of money in cash).

# Journal

## Session 1

I met 'Mad' Martigan and Hudson. It was after I accidentally stepped on an important package for a client and compensating for it. I was supposed to meet Hoya, but he cancelled the meeting at the very last moment. I was a bit sad, but Mr. Martigan and Mr. Hudson seemed to be good fellows (though I am still afraid of Mr. Hudson a bit. He said it was just an accident, but the pain!)--after all, we had caught the assassins trying to kill Phon Quartermail. Even though I could only get one gold (damn it my clumsy hands!), it was still a step forward to save up for my future exploration to home, not to mention potential travel mates.
 
## Session 2
 
Arvid often gets into troubles many times because of her 'career.' She should know about the gang, but the problem is that I don't know where she is. Hopefully, Father Fabitor knows her whereabouts. With Martigan and Hudson, we went to talk to him.
 
Phon was very discrete. Hudson seemed to have perceived something, but there was nothing concrete. Martigan bluffed, trying to get more information, but Phon was adamant on her secrecy. I was like, 'fine,' and tried to got to a guard house to report, but Father Fabitor mentioned gold: 80 gold each. I took the job.
 
To get more information, I asked the father about Arvid. Phon strangely babbled about Marta, probably Arvid in disguise. Yet, she was not there. The desk ladies told us that she would come in early tomorrow morning. Martigan seemed to worry about Marta, but, if she was indeed my friend, she could hold on her own.
 
Anyway, she was not there, so we decided to go to the warehouse. On the way, we saw many people on 'Shivers.' Poor souls.
 
The warehouse seemed to be used recently--no cobwebs. I believe it was there to 'cut the loose ends.'
 
On the next day early in the morning, we went to Phon's shop to talk to 'Marta.' She had a job for me, and I needed some information. Martigan and Hudson was adamant, so, in the end, she gave us a hint on Phon's financial situation.

Apparently, she was a mistress of some rich dude. Though we tried to drill for more information, all our efforts failed.

## Session 3

For the first thing in the morning, I visited Delver's Guild to join them (I heard that I can earn a lot in the dungeons). 10 gold annual membership fee was expensive I thought, but what the hack. They have job information!

After joining the guild, I started practicing archery. Next to the range, one guy was practicing swordmanship on dummies. He was competent in his sword skill. Maybe he could teach me a thing or two. So, we went to backyard.

But, the battle was not fair! Even before I got ready, Tuea (the swordman) came at me by surprise! I barely dodged the attack using the belt (hey! He came at me even before we started!) and trying to jump to his behind, but the belt glitched and I hang in the air upside down!

To get down, I pressed the button to get down, but it did the opposite; I started to levitate! If it was not for Hudson, I would have flied away like years ago. He tried to cut the belt with his dagger, but too bad! I tried that many times.

After that, Tuea gave me a piece of information on a potential job. People had promised some money to investigate the Old Greyson House. But, it was far from where we were, so we decided to investigate later with Martigan.

Anyway, it was time for us to go to the warehouse and ambush the killers. Hudson hid under wooden platform while I hid on it. Too bad that I picked wrong spot. One of the two guys started climbing up the stairs, and I was about to be discovered.

So, I jumped on the guy (Laucio) by putting weighty spell on him. He slowly draw his sword and attacked me. I dodged the attack, but it was too close. Meanwhile, Hudson attacked him, dealing a heavy blow, knocking him out.

Yet, unfortunately, that thump alerted the other guy (Vagger), and Vagger ran towards us. With sword, I ran towards him, but, due to my clumsiness, I slipped and fell on him after hitting Vagger with the side of my sword, knocking him out.

After the battle, I picked up a shield from Laucio. We got some golds too. As I used my potion of healing of reflexes, Martigan came in.

"You are late." I said with grin.
